I do not have too many major projects publicly available, but I do have an API that I developed to serve up content on a static website I maintain containing Peanuts comic strips (https://peanuts.today). You can read more about the origins/purpose of the site in [this Medium series](https://medium.com/@craig.burdulis/peanuts-today-exploring-the-peanuts-in-the-cloud-with-machine-learning-part-1-ea89f0899f23) if you're interested!

The API's source code is available [here](https://github.com/icj217/peanuts-comic-api) and specifically the [comics](https://github.com/icj217/peanuts-comic-api/blob/develop/src/routes/comics.js) route has some logic in it, but admittedly it's not much.

Thanks!
